The problem was I served every single one I made, and customers bought them. My manager had to apologize like a thousand times to dozens of people. He fired me for it.... I was so-diam mad. The restaurant biz isn't for me anyway." ,

We weren't great together, but anyway, I was sitting in my car while he ran into a fast food place to get our to-go order. Well, after agitating me all night, he decided it'd be funny to get on the hood of my car. I said 'screw it' and sped up to at least 30 miles an hour in this parkinglot. Then I slammed on the breaks and he rolled off the hood! I couldn't breathe I was laughing so hard....He managed to save the food though."
