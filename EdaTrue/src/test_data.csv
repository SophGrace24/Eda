 1 the idea of what it must be like to be on earth as it is in heaven from the lords prayer i feel like we were designed for a purpose rather than random chance a more concrete way to put it is simply show love to the greatest capacity we can 2 taking care of myself physically mentally spiritually 3 family 4 work 5 music
haha no one will interrupt you
its french for already seen i know its used when you see something for the second time or you have the feeling that something has happened before and youre reexperiencing it
lol ok
ahh would you consider yourself an outdoorsy type of person
thats pretty cool i hope you do well next week
tentative plan is to drive to la on 23rd and then stay at the disney resort for 2 nights i heard christmas eve they have loads of fun events
hello deja vu
nice what all places did you cover
if i continue to pretend to be a robot i would probably say i talk to myself the most i am trying to talk to computers more but you know computers dont like me
wow that is nice of you for the mentor program personally i prefer more 11 conversations than the group discussions the group discussion i useful as well but the topics are too general
i see seems like an interesting read

haha i appreciate your faith but their record thus far is hard to refute
hi
i found it very tough to learn but my friends picked it up very quickly i am sure you will do good
darn it i hoped id guess right what do you actually do for work
yes thats close my research focuses on jellyfish and pufferfish many of them a poisonous but if processed correctly they would make hiend foods i try to find the best recipes to bring these fish to the tables
very cool i have been working on my communication skills with my mentor this cycle
yea you can first dump your brain and wait until technology advances to wake up  dont you believe
i wont lie it sounds scary im scared right now just thinking about it
lol i will cross my fingers for you then
all the times my work involves a few types of fish and a few types of nets i just put the nets on the fish to see how the fish will react every time i do that i think of going to the beach
lol

cool step 2 talk with the person some more and ask them some more questions and gradually develop a sense of what theyre like over the course of maybe two to five years and voila

oh i have a friend who looks like the actor who plays spiderman

ive seen a couple episodes from the latest season its really random and weird but also strangely relatable which is why i like it 
i havent honestly i probably wouldnt be able to identify which sport they played
you should its a beautiful city
traveling to warm places haha when its cold you appreciate the warm climate more  if i am not traveling then i prefer there to be snow on the ground so i can go skiing or tubing down the mountain what about you
yes we graduated back in the seventies we meet for dinner every year and take turns to host
hi
who created you
haha thats awesome karaoke is really fun i do it with my friends sometimes
buying a tree is a neat experience i was torn between buying an artificialecofriendlyfake one vs a real one that smells like fresh pine in the end we opted for the one that we can disassemble every year
yea what else do you like to do beside movies
thank you bye
hahathanks how did you like the gift
hi 
i like doing spartan race its an obstacle race which is challenging but not overtly so like marathons and triathlons
neat what are yall eating
i was thinking on getting a large set of standard legos what will you get for yours
that does sound nice so what are you doing these holidays
cool are you thinking about starting a startup
hi
oh same here i think relaxing at home should be counted among the best ways to enjoy the holidays
great good idea to help people figuring out their new year resolutions  so how do i get a fresher outlook 
thats nice i am just working on some documentation do you play pingpong often
not a big turkey fan i find it too dry
i think so i havent finished it yet though understanding sleep better has been helping me value it more and ive been sleeping a lot earlier have you read any good books recently
i see are you planning to do any sporting events in the coming months
im a little scared because i have to cook dinner for some friends tonight
its on the screen i dont recall meeting you do you have a sense of where we met
cool ive started to run a bit as well not long distances though just a couple miles
yeah any vacation plans
a project ive been working on for some months got shelved so im a mix of helpless sad and angry
cool so if it werent so dark and cold outside what kind of activities would you do
yeah i play bit of guitar just got my first monitor this week
i see its probably also cheaper ill buy an artificial one too do you have any suggestions for the store
its just been a little over a year im still pretty amateur but i figured i should give competing a try and just put myself out there
theres this practice called treasure hunting thats kind of a fun game you play in a public place theres a book called the ultimate treasure hunt that talks about it you use your creativity to imagine people you will meet and you write down a description then you associate them with a positive message or encouraging word maybe you saw a teenage boy in a red hat at the shopping mall in your imagination then while at the mall you may find someone who matches that description you show that you have a message for him and that you have a message for a boy in a red hat you then give him a message of kindness or whatever was on your heart you have no idea sometimes you meet someone who is having a really hard day and it brings them to tears to have a stranger show them love
seems like we share a thing in common yay
ziplining
yea a little bit but its okay  what do you enjoy doing outside work
i see yeah some are pretty strange
glad to hear youre better sorry to hear you were sick i was sick a couple of weeks ago with a bad cough theres definitely a bug going around admit i just want to stay healthy for the holidays and plan to relax
what is mellow style
i had a strong intuitive feeling connected to pastries when we started chatting but that might have been because im hungry
yeah i grew up speaking it its pretty much mandatory here
ooh nice that sounds adventurous where is it
nice thats football right
yep we seemed to have made some great progress over last few years do you think the positives outweigh the negatives
what does that mean
bruhhhhhh
lol i tried this tangerine walnut icecream that was super weird
woah you know sharing is caring you should share that money with me 
oh wow a full obstable course that does sound fun i like the variety
im pretty amateur i like to climb at indoor climbing gyms and have never gone outside on dangerous routes actually ever tried it yourself
not too much just really looking forward to the holidays
oh really to be honest i think the actor is not that good looking so not so surprising haha
should we be helping them so it sucks less
theyre in new york how about yours
ah maybe thats the solution i need to enjoy sweets and not feel guilty 
how was it what trails did you ski on
i signed up this time to be a mentee i have got a good mentor 
the leading character is still alive and the bad robots was killed too so i guess it is happy ending
