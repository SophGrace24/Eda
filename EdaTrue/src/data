it is so different from what i am doing to earn a life
my partners former friend invited me for lunch they are not in good books right now but during their friendship i formed an independent bond with the other person because we all used to hang out a lot now i feel like i have to take sides
i might in the future the philosophy in the book also help for other things as well eg in research you might also want to be contrarian

i was kind of too young to really understand but apparently there are people who scam asian immigrants into investing in their own restaurant business i know that the other part of it was that my mom got sickhospitalized and we didnt have insurance to be honest i dont really know what really happened versus what my parents want people to think i just know that one minute i was in the us and then they put me on a plane to taiwan and i never saw my stuff again in some ways it made me more sentimental would you say you are more grounded and practical as a result of your background

well its like a cage match of tennis the main difference is that both players play in the same court and the ball is smashed against a wall instead of passing it over a net into the opponents court kind of like playing pingpong vs the table
its based on the life of a wall street hedge fund owner how he makes money and fights with the government when they try to destroy him very well made and has a good plot

hello how is your day
thats great hows the weather over the weekend i hope its warm
oh nice where did you live before
kayaking sounds fun i tried it in our last team offsite

hi
we created a scholarship for leaders from redacted_term to visit an international institute at redacted_term for which there was no african representation during the program we also did a lot of coaching with the young leaders this book captures a bit of that journey that we are all on and also all the proceeds are going to fund next years cohort

snow is not scary as long as youre prepared you just need to be ready to not have electricity for a while i enjoy the aftermath of a good snowstorm because then you can go sledding or skiing
who said i want to be a pastry chef haha
ah thats a good way of framing it me i like berries boysenberry one strawberry two maybe straight chocolate number 3 to mix it up a bit
did we dance together perchance
ground beef pretty easy
not much thinking about lunch
does not having had electricity help you empathize more with people of differing backgrounds andor makes you feel a bit a distance from those who dont understand
thanks for not spoiling it completely but you gave a really intriguing description that makes me want to read it now i will have to pick it up after work
ahh i saw a scary movie about that once it was about this sentient ai in a dystopian future  very very creepy it was called walle ever heard of it

yeah some people underestimate the importance of planning but i think its very important to have the correct plan executing the wrong plan is terrible also planning is fun you can stack up so many ideas and get great feedbacks

ooof very ambitious do you have steady hands
yeah i would say maybe every couple weeks or so what are your favorite cities to visit
not yet i always made my last minute schedule planning probably you can try to ask me again next week

yep i believe there is a day for that
lol are you a big marvel fan
my day is good a bit sad that it gets dark so early but oh well did you do anything fun over the weekend
yes but im terrible at it its fun to play anything with friends i think would you prefer to exercise with a group or by yourself do you think
im thinking of going to visit my family how about you
yeah i think so it might be a tough decision though if we want to have a nice dinner then we have to leave the parks early to start cooking another option is to have dinner at a restaurant
that sounds like a perfect plan
i live in tokyo japan
i am working on a new classifier
oh sorry to hear that but after that it will be a hard earned vacation
actually the menu looks good looking forward to it then
admit i really like watching modern family and mixish reruns and new episodes i find them cleverly written whatre you watching these days on tv
its about startups lots of useful principles and philosophies for innovation like being a contrarian
interesting i get that feeling sometimes it just feels that the event is replaying wonder why it happens
aww  i hope things will get less hard and you become an expert in it i heard many great things about yoga
hi
you might like the ufc haha i actually have a jiu jitsu tournament coming up so this weekend i will be training

how are you how is your day
i love you
haha  yeah i get sea sick on boats too nothing much just visiting some friends in san francisco
interesting i heard about the sweet substitute in a program called the keto diet basically we try to limit our sugar intake every day successful keto dieters have recommended the redacted_term ice cream to fill their insatiable crave for sugar
if you could eat only one food for the rest of time what would it be
i just released a book on redacted_term to help people process the past 12 months and start the new year with a fresh outlook
hello there how is it going
phew yes i can help with that
brooooo its so important when i got to california beaches i have to carry 3 litres of lotion for the whole day
i was flying my kite today in the sunshine what did you have for lunch
im good im good whats getting you down
hi
hi
lol
yes breakfast is the most important meal of the day what did you have i woke up late so unfortunately i only had the chance to grab an apple to go
yea me too i feel like god often puts strangers in front of you and gives you an opportunity to connect with them in that moment in deeply meaningful ways do you ever feel like you know things about strangers without them telling you
oh my gosh what was it like
haha you ate turkeys or you like calling your bunch turkey
not really it just requires a lot of patience you fill up the bait in the crabpot and drop it in the ocean then you wait for a couple of hours to pull the crabpots out and voila youd have crabs  if you are lucky
a couple projects that i am trying to finish up before thanksgiving  do you have any fun plans for the break
cool have you graduated already
im a lawyer so talking to clients most of the day
code refactoring you
same here i would imagine spending the whole time watching movies and netflix shows do you have any netflix recommendations for me
lol which cafe let me guess redacted_term
volunteers have to book the place before the event send out details of the event to participants handle some logistics and ensure everything goes smoothly it will be fun
heya nice to meet you im paul
thats a tough question i feel like my answer would have to be carrots although i would be afraid of turning orange after a few weeks what about you
its amazing the buildings are so tall and theres a lot of diversity of cultures
yeah im afraid i wouldnt i feel very guilty every time i gulp down an ice cream but hey these days there are many types of guiltfree sweet food for example theres this ice cream brand called redacted_term its only 320 calories a pint and yes it preserves most of the normal sweet flavors
hi
what do you mean
no im bad at science what can science do is it the most important thing for society
i will have to bake some soon and let you know what types of food do you like to eat
hi
hes the adopted brother of thor god of thunder and is burdened with glorious purpose do you feel that burden
photography is awesome dont be afraid to follow your dreams
i used to have a cat hamster and fighting fish but theyve all lived long lives and gone to pet heaven but i sure miss them
haha same its pretty scary when i run out of things to hold
uh oh id better not to plan for bbq then instead just enjoying playing board games inside
true i think thanksgiving is more about sharing so you may end up sharing the pie with the whole family p
how do you know so much about this french phrase
i was not able to figure out the last few slides i think its best to discuss this in person do you have time right now
i balance the books and do financial analysis for a medium sized company
busy busy ive had backtoback meetings all day

maybe a little bit where do you work
my friend used to tell me this and found it funny  mosquitos have 47 teeths

very well thanks for asking how has your day been
i think so too
from a high enough distance yes
i think i havent yet thanks have you tried 留湘 i think thats how you write it
cant complain work is going well and i had a tasty fish for lunch

hard to keep a count maybe 25
thanks i generally love noodle soups like pho or ramen
im taking a fake sick day from work so i can go to the movies
i love hawaii its a good place to be i like going there cause its humid so i never have to put on lotion
yes cant wait for the sequels
i am just enjoying a cigar at the moment how about yourself
you should drink more water do some push up and sleep early

hmm not the local people but there will be tons of people at the conference
lol sounds better to me  im actually at the redacted_term opening remarks
hows your day going
i think i know him does he have a sort of mellow style
it was really fun i had a great time with my family

thats a lot of meat what dish why are you consideringt o go vetegarian
i like badminton im quite decent at it
in the game i use vaporeon a lot but i think pikachu is the cutest thats why i changed my name to match lately i think baby yoda is the cutest though have you seen baby yoda
was the project through a church group
ping pong can get quite intensive too i guess short ping pong sessions are not that tiring though wanna have a match
im getting there every year until last year i tried to go somewhere for the christmas  new year and then i got bored traveling lol not sure if that means im getting old
yeah turning orange would be a drawback that turns my mind to nutrition so i suddenly want to say soylent or one of those other complete foods which i think defeats the purpose of the question im in a muddle
maybe its a little too early to even be thinking about this just aim for med school and enjoy the journey
i went to gym and worked on weight lifting
i feel you on that its important to balance all the different parts of your brain i like pottery because i also drink a lot of tea so i get to make some tea ware
yes its different every week and i love that are you ever tempted to try crazy new cakes just to see what would happen
well i actually think about pursuing photography but its really hard
im great thanks im getting ready for a skydiving lesson
san francisco its been raining cats and dogs here since last 23 weeks
you are very cool too
haha thanks do you plan any instruments

hehe sounds very interesting  i only see shows belonging to few genres  like easy going light comedy or phychological thrillers  also some manga based series like one punch man love it
oh wow sounds like a very dynamic kind of work which is nice i make a lot of the same cakes day in day out
yes and no because its obviously dangerous we all have to wear protective clothes thus accidents almost never happen
what is a break im a grad student i dont understand the concept of a break just kidding i dont have any plan probably just going to work through the break
hmmm yes i have heard that apparently most mountain climbers fall not on the most dangerous routes but on the easier routes when their guard is down sounds like the same psychological phenomenon
i would love to build one once i acquire the skills to what kind of tea is your favorite
oooo the mandalorian
what why would you do that take the least interesting day of the week off and work on the most interesting
oh i am sorry to hear what did you work on

no im not in school anymore
you mean as a mentor or a mentee
thats true its like the alphabets in a language once you know them you can pretty much write word
right i guess thats because there is no one answer to this it depends on what you value more and some factors around you also life wont be interesting if others are figuring things out for you
haha thanks have you tried any extreme sports
wdym by word origins here

i did more when i was in grad school and had more time i would usually go with friends for a while i would go to the farmers market in santa cruz every week and try to feel if there is something i am supposed to tell a stranger usually they are vague hopefilled messages but its weird when i blurt out something oddly specific
theres a taco place that ive visited before that i cant wait to go back to do you like tacos
same even though i bake i cannot cook
im doing great how are you
mint chocolate chips i think your croissants not being flakey could have something to do with your ovens temperature

i think its like a 6th sense often seen as cold readings to people but can be remarkably accurate i once sat next to a man in a coffee and i felt a pain in my back i asked the stranger if he had a pain it turns out that he did in the exact spot and said he pulled a muscle while dancing at a party i had never met the man before and never saw him again
