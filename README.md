# Eda AI Assistant (Eda.Asst.AI)

A simple but powerful AI assistant. Her main purpose is to be an aid for autistic individuals. Please read the requirements.txt, as well as the F.Eda.txt which highlights her basic functions. The project_summary.txt overviews the current status of Eda. The routine.txt and routine_blueprint.txt cover the basic overview, structure and roadmap of how the Routine Manager function is supposed to work.

It's important to note that I am relatively new to coding and this is an ambitious project. My goal is to prove to myself that I can do this. I am utilizing external resources to guide me during Eda's development.
If you have questions, please feel free to reach out. While I'm very happy to be a part of a community that guides and helps each other, please respect that I have a certain vision for Eda. As an Autistic individual myself, many of the resources out there are lackluster. At the end of the day, I want to create something that truly will help others. Even if she can't become as advanced as I want her to be, she'll be a great help for someone.

That being said, Eda is not strictly for Autistic individuals, though that is the audience I hope to reach. Anyone can utilize her features and resources if they feel it will help them. I encourage anyone who reads this to run the eda/main.py and provide feedback.

Another important thing to note is that this is my first time using Github. It's a bit of a learning curve. I apologize for commits/branches being a relative mess and updates not being as concise as they should be. I've deleted Eda 3-4 times and have had to start from scratch, repository and all.

Regardless, I appreciate that you're here as I walk this journey. As I said before, please feel free to reach out if you have questions or comments, ideas or suggestions. Anything is welcome.
