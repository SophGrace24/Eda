# Eda.Asst.AI

This is the beginnings of establishing Eda. My main goal is to train an overall comprehensive AI. 
However, this will have to come in strides because I only have a laptop and am not a million-dollar-company. 

My dream for Eda is to not only have a strong conversational base, but I want her to recognize the patterns between Neurotypical and Neurodivergent speech patterns. 
One of the functions I intend for her to possess requires that she can understand and explain what certain social situations mean, sarcasm, and other implied or indirect situations. 
I will focus on the actual AI model training as the first hurdle to tackle while simeltaneously developing an APP for her to occupy. 
I will post these app features another time but for now, here is a brief over-view: 
- Emergency Assistance, Collaborative virtual environments, Social Situation/Social Skills training and help, Creativity station.
- Certain settings: User can input pre-determined settings which Eda will initialize either by 1) Users request or 2) Certain factors have prompted her to react to the Users distress. --> This feature is more expansive than I explain here. However, it's important to mention that I intend for Eda to only have the User's Account name and Password, plus whatever information is saved from the User.

I really don't think anyone is going to read this thing, I might not even actually succeed in what I'm doing but I do know that I'm one of this 'tistics, and no matter how "high-functioning" I am, I consistently feel like I would benefit greatly from having some sort of assistant, a buddy, a home-health nurse. 
I can't speak for anyone else, and it's not like I'm suffering, but I constantly feel the limitations of my capabilities. It would be nice to have an accessible AI assistant where one of her main goals is to explain social situations, provide sensory friendly stimuli, aid in routine/schedules, help with transitions, engage with hyperfixations and special interests, help explain social situations, help explain how we come across, provide outlets, provide community. 

But anyway, there is more to come and a more official version of the README is on the way too.
